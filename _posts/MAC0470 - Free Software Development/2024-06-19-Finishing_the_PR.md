## Finishing the PR

Yesterday I finished the change requests of PR on kworkflow and today I receive the return of David that my PR was merged to unstable branch.

I've also received [feedback](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iio/20240613153920.14647-1-hagisf@usp.br/) from the kernel maintainers, and it seems that in the last e-mail they didn't ask for a change but are just letting me know. I guess that means my patch has been accepted already.
