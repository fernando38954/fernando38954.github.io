## Correcting the Patch

As I have other subjects and tasks to do, I haven't been able to do anything about free software in the meantime, but I have just managed to correct the errors and send a v2 patch to the iio kernel maintainers today.

Now I'm going to see if I can find a nice topic on the kw issues so I can study it. If I do, I'll come back and modify this post.

I found a interesting issue on kw with tag of "good for first issue", so I hope that I can solve it.

The issue is about [Inconsistencies with kw drm](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/issues/1002), for detailed description please see click in the link of page.
