## The Nexts Steps

In today's lesson all the groups should present what they did during that time and say what they intend to do next.

In the case of my part, fixing the debian package took longer than I expected, so of the remaining time I could only read the feedback from the maintainers and try to understand the changes they requested.

But my partner, when I asked him what he'd done over the weekend, he toud methat he didn't do anything about what we'd discussed last Thursday, he didn't even look up what we could do at the kw. After that, he tried to find something during the lesson that we could say in front of the class and to the teacher.

I apologize here that I got quite angry with him when I heard him say that.

Luckily for him, as we have a lot of people in the class, our presentation was left for the next lesson. However, I still parted company with him, so that everyone can do what they want.

So now I need to simultaneously correct the error reported by the maintainers, while looking for something interesting to contribute to kw.

The good news is that we have 4 days off to do this, but the bad news is that 3 of them I have work the entire day and I won't be able to make progress on these subjects.

I hope I can do some satisfactory things in a short time and show them in the classroom.
