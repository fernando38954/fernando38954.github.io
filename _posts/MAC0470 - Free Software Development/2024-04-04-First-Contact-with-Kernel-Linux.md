## First Contact with Kernel Linux

This semester I'm taking the MAC0470-Free Software Development offered by the Mathematics Institute of the University of Sao Paulo. And one of the reasons I'm creating this blog is because of this course.

In this course we will learn why and how to contribute to the huge free software community that has existed around the world, learning about its history and its techniques for later contribution.

In the first step, we need to set up a virtual machine using QEMU to create an environment for testing our code. To do this, we follow the tutorials written by **FLUSP**, 
the free software community at USP, and this week, we have just finished the first workshop consisting of the following 3 tutorials in exactly this sequence:

1. [Use QEMU and libvirt to setup a Linux kernel test environment](https://flusp.ime.usp.br/kernel/qemu-libvirt-setup/)
2. [Build the Linux kernel for ARM](https://flusp.ime.usp.br/kernel/build-linux-for-arm/)
3. [Introduction to kernel build configuration and modules](https://flusp.ime.usp.br/kernel/modules-intro/)

During the study, due to the fact that I didn't follow exactly the creation of the directory in these tutorials, I had a small problem completing these tutorials because I couldn't find the path of the directory I created,
but after a few attempts, the problem was solved and I finished these three tutorials successfully. 

Even though everything went well here, my partner Eduardo had a lot of problems with the tutorial because he didn't read the instructions and explanatory texts, so his progress was lagging behind the rest of the class.

Apart from that there were no major problems due to the help of the monitors who are helping us to get started. Thanks for your help! :smile:
