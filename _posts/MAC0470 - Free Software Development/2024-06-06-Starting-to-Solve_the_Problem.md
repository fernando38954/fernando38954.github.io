## Starting to Solve the Problem

After studying the code in class last year and in the meantime, I've started to solve the problems described in the issue, one by one, and in the meantime I've also fixed some shellcheck errors and easy-to-solve problems that weren't mentioned in the issue.

The details can be seen in the following PR: [src: plugins: subsystems: drm: Fix inconsistencies of kw drm #1134](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/pull/1134)
