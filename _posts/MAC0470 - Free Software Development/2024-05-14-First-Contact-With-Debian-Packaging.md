## First Contact With Debian Packaging

In the today's workshop, we have lecture given by Joenio Costa, Perl developer and Debian package maintainer for the Perl ecosystem.

Frist he taught us about the basic concept of Debian packaging, such as it poupose, tools for it, the production ecosystem, etc.

Then, we start the first step of Debian packaging, following the tutorials bellow written by Joenio:

1. [Tutorial de empacotamento Debian - Parte 1](https://joenio.me/tutorial-pacote-debian-parte1/)

In this tutorial, we need to download a simple library called Acme::Helloworld, which just prints a "Hello World".

And by modifying the files generated by the program, we have to packaged it and test it by installing it on our computer. See if it works or not.

So far I haven't any problem when following the tutorial, but due to time, we stops in the middle of tutorial, and need to return here in the next Thursday.
