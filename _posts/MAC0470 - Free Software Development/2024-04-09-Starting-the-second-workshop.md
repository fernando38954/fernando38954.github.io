## Starting the Second Workshop

As mentioned in the title, today we start the second workshop of the MAC0470 course, just like the first one, we follow these tutorials written by FLUSP:

1. [Introduction to Linux kernel Character Device Drivers](https://flusp.ime.usp.br/kernel/char-drivers-intro/)
2. [The iio_simple_dummy Anatomy](https://flusp.ime.usp.br/iio/iio-dummy-anatomy/)

 ~~(Actually, we didn't use the first one and started straight from the second tutorial, but I've put it up because it's on the course page)~~
 
 The second tutorial doesn't have much to do in terms of code (actually, nothing), but it does have a lot of text that has to be read, I'm not sure I understand it but I hope that in future tutorials we can try out the knowledge we've acquired.
