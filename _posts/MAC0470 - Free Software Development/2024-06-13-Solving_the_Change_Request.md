## Solving the Change Request

Since I was sick, I didn't go to class on Tuesday and I didn't make much progress during that time. What I did was read the change request from the maintainer and think about how to solve it. 

Today I started solving the maintainer requests, with the help of the monitors I managed to solve all of them.

And while I'm at it, I solved the last change request for the kernel patch (I think it should be the last one).

Also, the perl group hasn't responded yet, hopefully they'll be able to respond before July.
